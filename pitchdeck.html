### **Pitch Deck Development**

This new conversation will focus on creating a pitch deck for a strategic business proposal. The goal of this deck is to present a business opportunity to my direct manager and a senior-level manager.

The proposal is for an AI-powered knowledge management system for event production at the Google campus.

The following information should be used to guide the development of the pitch deck.

**My Background & Strategic Mindset**

I am an A1 audio specialist event technician at Google, working as a contractor for First Agency. My core professional ethos is practical and efficient, rooted in a "salt of the earth" approach. My ideas are driven by a problem-solving mindset and a belief that human evolution is tied to technology, a philosophy inspired by Ray Kurzweil. I have a passion for encouraging my coworkers to adopt AI, acting as an informal agent for change. I also have a unique, intuitive approach to coding that I call "vibe coding."

My pitch is designed to be low-risk and forward-looking. I want to frame it as a way to perfect an already great service and strengthen our agency's relationship with Google, a concept I refer to as "Relational ROI."

**My Concerns & The Strategy**

I am concerned that any intellectual property (IP) I develop might be owned by my company under the work-for-hire doctrine. My solution to this is to present the project as a strategic business proposal for the agency to adopt.

My approach is to not offer a job title in the initial pitch, as this is a topic for future negotiation.

**The Audience**

My audience is comprised of two key individuals:
1.  **Direct Manager:** My first audience is a trusted manager and a member of the AI task force who is behind the curve but eager to learn. This meeting is for practice and to build a key alliance.
2.  **Senior Manager:** The second audience is a manager two levels above my direct manager. He is a key advocate who is very interested in data and AI and can champion the proposal.

**The Full Pitch Text**

**Title:** Beyond the Manuals: A New Way to Manage AV Knowledge

**Introduction:**

"As a member of the AI Task Force, I've identified a significant opportunity to improve our service offerings. I propose we build and pilot a new AI-powered service that will revolutionize how our team members and clients interact with event production technical documents, providing both a technological edge and clear business benefits."

**1. The Challenge: Unlocking Our Full Potential**

"Our industry relies on a huge amount of technical information. The problem is, all this knowledge is stuck in static documents, and it can take time and effort to get a complete answer. You can't just 'step inside a diagram' to ask a question about a specific piece of gear or its dependencies on other components. This creates a significant business risk, as critical information is not only isolated in static documents but also exists solely in the minds of a few key experts. This system will empower new team members to rapidly gain expertise, and it will give our seasoned pros the tools to more easily and efficiently cross-train, further perfecting our team's operational excellence. We can solve this by pioneering a new approach to make our knowledge instantly accessible and interactive, enhancing our overall expertise."

**2. The Solution: The AVbase Pilot**

"I propose we develop an in-house pilot project for the Google campus, which I am calling **AVbase**. This system is specifically designed to address an emerging need for a centralized, interactive knowledge baseâ€”a need underscored by Google's recent request for formal user guides and one-sheets. AVbase will be a secure, AI-powered knowledge base that can instantly answer complex, room-specific questions in natural language, transforming our comprehensive library of technical documents into an indispensable asset."

"The system's core is a **proprietary workflow** I've developed. This workflow is a repeatable, methodical process for efficiently ingesting, processing, and organizing our clients' technical documentation. The methodology and its resulting output would be owned by our agency, serving as the foundation for a new, scalable service line."

"The choice to pilot this at Google is strategic. It allows us to prove the concept and its value within a contained, familiar environment, minimizing risk while demonstrating a powerful solution for our most important client. A further upside, should the opportunity arise, is the potential for Google to contribute to the project's infrastructure, which would be an invaluable asset to us."

**3. The Value Proposition: The ROI for Our Agency**

"This project is not just a solution for Google; it is a new, scalable service line for our agency."

* **A Strategic Pilot:** "This pilot will serve as our proof of concept for a new service line. By demonstrating the system's value on the Google campus, we can build a scalable and repeatable service that can be rolled out across the company."
* **Room for Growth:** "The proprietary workflow I've developed will allow us to efficiently roll out this service to other departments and campus locations within Google, creating a new, reliable, and predictable revenue stream within our most important account."
* **Competitive Advantage:** "By pioneering this service, we will be one of the first agencies to actively integrate a proprietary AI workflow into our core offerings. This will position us as a tech-driven and forward-thinking partner, giving us a unique advantage in a market that is quickly evolving."

**4. Enhancing Operational Excellence & Strategic Partnership**

"The AVbase system is designed to build on our team's existing excellence."

**For the Team:** "It provides instant, verifiable knowledge that empowers new hires and contractors to rapidly achieve the same level of expertise as our most experienced technicians. It also facilitates cross-campus training, allowing a seasoned technician to walk into a new room they've never seen before and immediately understand the operational details, routing, and gear."

**For Google:** "The AVbase system offers a powerful solution by directly addressing Google's request for formal room documentation. It provides a strategic solution for Google's data security needs by centralizing all technical documentation and proprietary routing into a secure, internal knowledge base. This protects valuable information that is often scattered across various personal documents and devices, and it positions us as a strategic partner committed to helping Google formalize and secure its intellectual property."

**5. My Role: The AI Implementation Manager**

"I am uniquely positioned to lead this initiative. I have the hands-on technical expertise to understand the problem, and my skills to develop this AI solution were inspired by my experiences with the AI Task Force. My proposed role would be to manage the entire process, from initial data preparation to user rollout, and to improve our workflow by building a blueprint for scaling this service agency-wide. I will also work directly with our teams to help them develop an efficient AI workflow, ensuring a smooth transition to a more data-driven and interactive environment."

---

**6. The Plan: A Phased, Low-Risk Approach**

"I propose a phased approach to manage risk and demonstrate value:"

* **Phase 1: Legal & Strategic Review:** "This is a critical first step. We'll work with our legal team to review the contractual and copyright implications and get a formal green light to proceed with the pilot."
* **Phase 2: Pilot Implementation:** "We'll focus on a single, complex room at Google that has an identical counterpart. This will allow me to perfect the workflow and prove the system's value and repeatability with a contained, measurable project."
* **Phase 3: Scale:** "Once the pilot is successful, we can move forward with a plan to scale the AVbase to the counterpart room, other departments, and additional campuses. This phased approach will demonstrate the project's broad potential and minimize risk."

---

**Conclusion:**

"This is an opportunity to not only solve a critical problem for our most important client but also to invent a new role for myself and a new service for our agency. I believe AVbase is a powerful demonstration of our commitment to innovation and will provide significant value for years to come."
